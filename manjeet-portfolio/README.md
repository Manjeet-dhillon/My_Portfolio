# Manjeet Singh — Excited Portfolio 🔥

This is a high-energy, animated portfolio built with **HTML + CSS + JavaScript** (no framework).
It includes: About, Skills, Ongoing Learning, Education, Experience, and a Contact/Query form + social links.

## Run locally

Just open `index.html` in your browser.

## Deploy (GitHub Pages)

1. Create a new repo on GitHub (e.g., `portfolio`)
2. Upload all files from this folder
3. Go to **Settings → Pages**
4. Set Source: **Deploy from a branch** → Branch: **main** → Folder: **/root**
5. Save — your site will get a link.

## Contact form

Currently uses **mailto** (opens email app). If you want a real form:

- **Formspree:** create a form endpoint and replace the JS submit handler
- **Netlify Forms:** deploy to Netlify and add the Netlify attributes

## Edit content

Open `index.html` and update text in these sections:

- Hero, About, Skills, Ongoing Learning, Education, Experience
- Social links are already set to your LinkedIn + GitHub + Email

Enjoy 🚀
